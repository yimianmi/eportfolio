    <h2 class="section-title">About This Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my e-Portfolio for EME 6208: Designing Integrated Media Environments.
        Throughout this course, I explored how multimedia tools can support teaching,
        communication, and creative work. Before this class, I mainly worked in music
        composition, so learning web design, animation, and video editing opened a new area
        for expressing ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
        This portfolio collects all the major projects I completed—image editing,
        interactive web activities, video production, digital animation, and a screencast.
        Each project taught me something different about how visual design, technology,
        and instruction work together. Building this final website also helped me understand
        how to organize content clearly and design a site that others can navigate easily.
    </p>

<!-- IMAGE EDITING -->
<section id="image-editing">
    <h2 class="section-title">Image Editing</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Bitmap and Vector Imagery</h3>

        <p>
            In this project, I created a book cover and a personal logo using bitmap and vector
            techniques. I explored tools such as masking, layering, color blending, and contrast
            control. One goal was to understand how bitmap images work best for detailed textures,
            while vector graphics are ideal for clean shapes and scalable designs. Designing a
            book cover required choices about layout, balance, and focal points, while creating
            a logo taught me how simple shapes can communicate identity.
        </p>

        <p>
            As someone who studies composition, the process felt similar to arranging musical
            textures. Just as different instruments create different colors, bitmap and vector
            formats each bring a distinct visual character. Learning how to combine them helped
            me think more clearly about visual storytelling. This project also helped me become
            comfortable with tools like cropping, adjustment layers, and typography systems,
            which I had rarely used before.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through this assignment, I gained confidence in designing graphics that are clean,
            expressive, and ready for both print and digital use. It taught me the importance
            of clarity, consistency, and simplicity—principles that also matter when designing
            teaching materials or musical scores.

        <h3>Interactive Quiz & Extended Chords Quiz</h3>

        <p>
            For this project, I built two interactive learning tools: a 10-question music theory
            quiz and a drag-and-drop activity about extended chords (9th, 11th, and 13th).
            These two pages helped me understand how HTML provides structure, CSS controls style,
            and JavaScript adds interactivity. I designed a simple layout, adjusted colors,
            created buttons, and wrote code for instant feedback. The process required careful
            testing because even a small mistake could break the interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
            As someone who teaches and writes music, I found it exciting to turn music-theory
            ideas into interactive learning tools. It made me think about how students learn
            best—through small steps, clear visuals, and trial-and-error exploration.
            Converting harmony concepts into drag-and-drop items helped me simplify the content
            and make it more accessible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Publishing the projects through GitHub Pages was another important learning moment.
            I learned how to upload files, manage a repository, and generate a live website
            link. This skill will be very useful for building online teaching materials or
            hosting my own music-related projects in the future.

    <h2 class="section-title">Video Production</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
        <h3>“How Music Helps Us Relax”</h3>

        <p>
            For this assignment, I created a short educational video explaining how music affects
            relaxation. I used iMovie with its built-in transitions, the Ken Burns effect,
            background music, and recorded narration. My goal was to create a calm, gentle
            atmosphere, so I chose soft colors and slow pacing in both visuals and audio.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working with audio layers felt familiar because of my music background, but syncing
            them with images required new skills. I learned how transitions shape emotional flow,
            how to balance narration with background music, and how to design sequences that feel
            smooth and meaningful. The process taught me how even small timing changes can improve
            clarity for learners.
        </p>

        <p>
            Creating this video helped me understand how multimedia storytelling works and how
            educational content can be made more engaging through pacing, visuals, and sound.
            These skills will help me design future teaching videos about music and composition.

<!-- ANIMATION -->
<section id="digital-animation">
    <h2 class="section-title">Animation</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
        <h3>“How Velocity Works”</h3>

        <p>
            In this project, I created a short animation explaining the idea of velocity. I used
            Canva to design the shapes and layout, and then iMovie to add motion, narration, and
            timing. At first, I struggled to make the ball and arrows move naturally. Animation
            requires careful thinking about direction, timing, and visual rhythm—elements similar
            to phrasing in music.
        </p>

        <p>
            I experimented with different frame pacing, object movement, and transitions to make
            the explanation easier to understand. Recording the narration also taught me how to
            keep explanations simple and clear for learners. This project made me more aware of
            how animation can help explain abstract concepts through visual cues and step-by-step
            motion.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end, I learned that animation does not need to be complicated to be effective.
            With thoughtful pacing and clean visuals, even a basic design can create a smooth and
            helpful learning experience.

<!-- SCREENCAST -->
<section id="screencast">
    <h2 class="section-title">Screencast</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Sibelius Music Score Tutorial</h3>

        <p>
            For this screencast, I recorded a demonstration of how to create a basic music score
            in Sibelius on a Mac. I explained steps such as creating a new file, entering notes,
            editing rhythms, adding articulations, and using playback tools. I also used cursor
            highlighting and zooming to guide the viewer’s attention.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making this screencast helped me understand the importance of clarity and pacing in
            instructional media. Although I use Sibelius often as a composer, teaching the software
            required a different perspective. I needed to slow down, make each step visible, and
            explain why certain tools matter. This process helped me appreciate how screencasts
            support visual and procedural learning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through this project, I learned how to plan a clear structure, prepare a script, and
            use editing tools to remove distractions. Recording my screen also gave me practical
            experience that I can use for teaching music notation or sharing composition workflows
            with students in the future.

<!-- FINAL E-PORTFOLIO REFLECTION -->

        <h3>E-Portfolio Reflection</h3>

        <p>
            Building this e-portfolio was one of the most meaningful parts of the course.
            I brought together all the projects—image editing, web design, video creation,
            animation, and screencasting—into one website that shows my growth throughout the semester.
            I learned how to structure a website, create consistent styling, design navigation,
            manage external files, and publish my work online.
        </p>

        <p>
            Creating this portfolio also helped me think about how multimedia design connects
            with my work in music. As a composer, I often think about structure, balance, and
            flow. I realized that web design uses many of the same ideas: clear layout, visual
            hierarchy, color balance, and pacing. Organizing the projects into sections felt
            similar to organizing movements in a composition—each part has its own purpose but
            also contributes to the whole.
        </p>

        <p>
            The portfolio helped me reflect on how technology can support teaching and creative
            communication. I now feel more confident using multimedia tools to design educational
            materials, present musical ideas, or share creative work online. This website represents
            not only what I learned from each project, but also how I grew in connecting design,
            technology, and my own artistic background.
